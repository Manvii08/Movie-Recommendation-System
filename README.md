# Movie-Recommendation-System
• Content based movie recommendation system that suggests movies based on similarities using score calculated elicited from cosine similarity metrics.
• Metadata (Name, Genre, Name of the director, etc.) fetched using an API by TMDB for years 2018-20 and used Kaggle for movies released before 2017.
• Pandas, NumPy libraries used for preprocessing the data.
